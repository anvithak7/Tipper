# Project 1 - Tipper

**Tipper** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Anvitha Kachinthaya**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [X] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [X] Custom tip amounts

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Ensuring the animation worked as desired, especially with areas moving up and down as required, was challenging while working on developing an app for the first time. I have not yet been able to animate the app to match my vision 

## Ideas for the Future

- Adding a database for users to store past total amounts and the restaurants they were spent at to calculate food budgets (throughout history and monthly).
